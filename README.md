# NYC-Subway-Data-Analysis
In this Project, I looked at NYC Subway Data to find out whether more people ride the subway when it’s raining versus when it’s not. I compared New York City Subway data, used statistical methods and data visualization to draw an interesting conclusion about the subway with the dataset that I analyzed.  See project
